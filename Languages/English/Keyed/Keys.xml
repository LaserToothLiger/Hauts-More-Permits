<!--Mod settings-->
<HVMP_SettingChaosMode>E-branches issue quests on independent timers</HVMP_SettingChaosMode>
<HVMP_TooltipChaosMode>Enterprise quests are issued to the player on a timer whose duration is set below. How the timer works is determined by this setting:\n\n-If enabled, each e-branch issues quests based on its own timer.\n\n-If disabled, there is one timer, and whenever it triggers only ONE e-branch will issue a quest.</HVMP_TooltipChaosMode>
<HVMP_SettingMinDays>Min days between random e-branch quests</HVMP_SettingMinDays>
<HVMP_TooltipMinDays>Each e-branch periodically offers a quest to the player. This is the minimum amount of time it takes to receive an e-branch quest. Each e-branch's first quest is unaffected by this timer - it always takes 1-10 days to occur.</HVMP_TooltipMinDays>
<HVMP_SettingMaxDays>Max days between random e-branch quests</HVMP_SettingMaxDays>
<HVMP_TooltipMaxDays>Each e-branch periodically offers a quest to the player. This is the maximum amount of time it takes to receive an e-branch quest. Each e-branch's first quest is unaffected by this timer - it always takes 1-10 days to occur.</HVMP_TooltipMaxDays>
<HVMP_SettingRewardFactor>E-branch quest reward factor</HVMP_SettingRewardFactor>
<HVMP_TooltipRewardFactor>Multiplies the amount of standing and/or goodwill you gain with an e-branch by completing any one of their quests.\nBy default, the rewards for most e-branch quests are usually 3-5 standing or 14-17 goodwill.\nAt minimum, rewards are usually 2-3 standing or 11-12 goodwill.\nAt maximum, rewards are usually 5-7 standing or 17-25 goodwill.</HVMP_TooltipRewardFactor>
<HVMP_TooltipMinExpectationLevel>Min expectations for penalties: &lt;color=#FF6BBF&gt;{0}&lt;/color&gt;</HVMP_TooltipMinExpectationLevel>
<HVMP_TooltipExpectationLevel>You will lose goodwill with e-branches when you refuse or fail one of their quests, ONLY IF you have a colony with enough wealth to have expectations of the selected level or higher.\n\nSelect "Inactive" to disable this entirely.\n-If this and the other goodwill penalty setting are both inactive, goodwill loss will not occur.\n-If this is inactive but the other one is active, goodwill loss occurs if the other setting's condition is met.\n-If both are active, goodwill loss will occur only when both conditions are met.</HVMP_TooltipExpectationLevel>
<HVMP_TooltipMinSeniorityLevel>Min title for penalties: &lt;color=#FF6BBF&gt;{0}&lt;/color&gt;</HVMP_TooltipMinSeniorityLevel>
<HVMP_TooltipSeniorityLevel>You will lose goodwill with e-branches when you refuse or fail one of their quests, ONLY IF you have a pawn with a title from that e-branch of the selected level or higher.\n\nSelect "Inactive" to disable this entirely.\n-If this and the other goodwill penalty setting are both inactive, goodwill loss will not occur.\n-If this is inactive but the other one is active, goodwill loss occurs if the other setting's condition is met.\n-If both are active, goodwill loss will occur only when both conditions are met.</HVMP_TooltipSeniorityLevel>

<HVMP_Level>Level {0} title</HVMP_Level>
<HVMP_SettingGoodwillRefusal>Goodwill lost from refusing quests</HVMP_SettingGoodwillRefusal>
<HVMP_TooltipGoodwillRefusal>If you fulfill either the 'minimum expectation' or 'minimum title' conditions set above, you will lose this much goodwill whenever you let an e-branch quest expire without accepting it.\n\nIf both a minimum expectation and title have been selected, both conditions must be fulfilled.\n\nChanging this value will only affect the penalty for FUTURE quests, not ones that have already been generated.</HVMP_TooltipGoodwillRefusal>
<HVMP_SettingGoodwillFailure>Goodwill lost from failing quests</HVMP_SettingGoodwillFailure>
<HVMP_TooltipGoodwillFailure>If you fulfill either the 'minimum expectation' or 'minimum title' conditions set above, you will lose this much goodwill whenever you fail an accepted e-branch quest.\n\nIf both a minimum expectation and title have been selected, both conditions must be fulfilled.\n\nChanging this value will only affect the penalty for FUTURE quests, not ones that have already been generated.</HVMP_TooltipGoodwillFailure>
<HVMP_SettingAnomalyActivityLevel>Occult Branch can always be encountered</HVMP_SettingAnomalyActivityLevel>
<HVMP_TooltipAnomalyActivityLevel>By default, the Occult Branch will only show up after the monolith has been activated (if using the standard Anomaly playstyle), have its frequency of contact multiplied by the anomaly activity level (if using Ambient Horror), or otherwise not be active at all.\n\nIf you enable this setting, they will not be subject to these rules, instead appearing as frequently as other e-branches.</HVMP_TooltipAnomalyActivityLevel>
